# Recipe Finder
A simple Python program that finds recipes with the ingredients you provide

This is a project I built for the 2023 CfC. You can make your own recipes.json following the format below, or you can run download.py if you have git installed.
The format for each recipe should go something like this:
```
{
    "Recipe Name": {
            "directions": [
                "some",
                "stuff"
            ],
            "ingredients": [
                "Yummy",
                "Things"
            ],
            "language": "en-US",
            "source": "TheWebsite.com",
            "title": "Recipe Name",
            "url": "TheWebsite.com/bestrecipe"
             
    },
    "Another Recipe": {
    ....json cont
}
```
